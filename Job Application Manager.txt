### **Project Plan: Job Application Lifecycle Manager (JALM)**

This document outlines the technical requirements for a desktop application designed to automate job application folder creation, template management, and interview tracking.

#### **1. System Architecture**

* **Language:** Python
* **GUI Framework:** `CustomTkinter` (for a modern UI) or `PyQt6`.
* **Data Persistence:** * `config.json`: Stores user paths (Root folder, CV/CL templates).
* `applications.db`: SQLite database for tracking metadata, statuses, and interview logs.


* **File Operations:** `pathlib` for cross-platform path handling; `shutil` for file cloning.

#### **2. Data Schema (SQLite)**

**Table: `applications**`
| Column | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `id` | INTEGER | Primary Key. |
| `company_name` | TEXT | Name of the company. |
| `role_name` | TEXT | Specific job title. |
| `folder_path` | TEXT | Absolute path to the role folder. |
| `status` | TEXT | Applied, Interviewing, Rejected, Offer, Ghosted. |
| `created_at` | DATETIME | Date of folder creation. |

**Table: `interviews**`
| Column | Type | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `id` | INTEGER | Primary Key. |
| `app_id` | INTEGER | Foreign Key linking to `applications.id`. |
| `sequence` | INTEGER | The interview number (1, 2, 3, etc.). |
| `notes` | TEXT | Detailed notes/feedback. |
| `date` | DATETIME | Date of the interview. |

#### **3. Functional Modules**

**Module A: Initialization & Setup**

* **Check Config:** On startup, verify `config.json` exists.
* **Setup Wizard:** If not found, launch a modal to select:
1. `Root_Directory` (Where applications are stored).
2. `CV_Template_Path` (Source .docx).
3. `CL_Template_Path` (Source .docx).



**Module B: Application Creator**

1. **Input:** User enters `Company` and `Role`.
2. **Logic:** * Create directory: `Root/Company/Role`.
* Copy templates to directory.
* Rename files to `[Company]_[Role]_CV.docx`.


3. **DB Update:** Insert a new record into the `applications` table.
4. **System Action:** Open the folder using `os.startfile` (Windows) or `subprocess.run(["open", path])` (macOS).

**Module C: Search & Tracking**

* **Search Engine:** A search bar filtering a `Listbox` or `ScrollableFrame` based on `company_name` or `role_name`.
* **Dashboard:** aggregate `SELECT COUNT(*)` to show total applications and unique companies.

**Module D: Interview Manager**

* **Incremental Logic:** When "Add Interview" is clicked:
* Count existing rows in `interviews` for that `app_id`.
* Label the new entry as `Interview N+1`.


* **Storage:** Save notes immediately to the SQLite DB.

#### **4. Development Roadmap**

| Phase | Milestone | Key Tasks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **1** | **Core Logic** | Script for folder creation, file copying, and SQLite initialization. |
| **2** | **Setup GUI** | Create the first-time config modal and directory pickers. |
| **3** | **Dashboard UI** | Implement the main list view, search bar, and statistics cards. |
| **4** | **Interview Log** | Build the nested UI for adding and viewing sequential interview notes. |
| **5** | **Polish** | Add error handling (e.g., folder already exists) and "Open Folder" shortcuts. |

#### **5. Technical Constraints**

* **File Integrity:** If a user manually deletes a folder, the program should flag the DB entry as "Path Not Found."
* **Concurrency:** SQLite handles single-user writes well, but ensures the DB connection is closed properly on app exit.
* **Templates:** Support `.docx` primarily, as `.pdf` is usually the export format.
